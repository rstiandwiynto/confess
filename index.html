            &emsp;I've been keeping this in for a while, but I think today is
            the perfect time to say it—you're the reason my days feel brighter.
            Every little moment with you means more than I can put into words.
            Your smile, your laughter, the way you make everything feel
            lighter—it all makes my heart race in the best way possible.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            &emsp;So, here it is… I like you, a lot. Maybe even love. Would you
            be my Girlfriend😆? No matter your answer, I just wanted you to know
            how special you are for me. You've filled my heart with warmth in
            ways I never expected, and for that, I'm grateful. But if you say
            yes, I promise to make every day feel like Happier Day for you—to
            cherish you, to make you smile, and to remind you just how much you
            mean to me.
          </span>

          <p>Your Admirer</p>
